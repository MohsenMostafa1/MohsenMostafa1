## Hi I'm Mohsen Mostafa 👋

 ### AI Lead-Senior AI Developer and Visionary

AI Lead - R&D in Computer Vision and Robotics | AI Applications Architect | AI Lead at GraviLog I am an AI leader and developer passionate about building next-generation intelligent agents that go beyond analysis—agents that reason, act, and adapt in real-world environments. My expertise spans retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal AI (text, image, audio), autonomous reasoning, and real-time token streaming, combined with strong foundations in scalable backend systems using FastAPI, Docker, Hugging Face, and cutting-edge LLMs like DeepSeek, Falcon, and CLIP. Currently serving as AI Lead at GraviLog (Remote, Part-time), I guide the strategic vision, architecture, and deployment of AI solutions that transform how businesses in manufacturing, healthcare, and enterprise SaaS operate. My role blends hands-on development with executive-level communication, ensuring innovation stays both technically robust and business-aligned. What drives me is shaping AI not just as a tool but as a collaborative co-pilot—a trusted partner that empowers humans with scalable intelligence, explainability, and adaptability. I continue to explore how AI agents can seamlessly integrate into real-world ecosystems, augmenting human capabilities across industries and unlocking new possibilities for the future.  

I am passionate about data and believe in AI's power to improve people's lives. I want to transfer my passion to others and my goals that represent help for people in business and humanity.
